Generative AI application to summarise and recommend actions based on an application for a commercial loan.


To apply for a commercial loan, the following information is typically required:
1. Business Information: You will need to provide information about your business, such as its legal name, business address, tax ID number, and the date it was established.
2. Business Plan: A detailed business plan may be required, including information about your business strategy, products or services, target market, competition, and financial projections.
3. Financial Statements: You will need to provide financial statements for your business, including balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements for the past few years. These statements should be prepared by a certified public accountant (CPA) and should be reviewed or audited.
4. Collateral: You may need to provide collateral to secure the loan. Collateral can include real estate, equipment, inventory, or accounts receivable.
5. Personal Information: You will need to provide personal information, such as your name, address, Social Security number, and personal financial statements.
6. Credit History: Your personal and business credit history will be reviewed, so it's important to have a good credit score and clean credit history.
7. Legal Documentation: You may need to provide legal documents, such as your business licenses and registrations, partnership agreements, or articles of incorporation.
8. Loan Purpose: You will need to explain the purpose of the loan and how the funds will be used. This information helps the lender determine the risk of the loan and whether it's a good investment for them.
